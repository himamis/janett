Janett released under the LGPL license version 2.1 available in distributions in lgpl.txt file.

Janett uses Modified version (See http://mayaf.org/janett/wiki/NRefactory) of NRefactory library from SharpDevelop (http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/) project. 
NRefactory licensed under LGPL license so we:
-Contributed back these changes to include in original version.
-Also NRefactory translated from .Net 2.0 to .Net 1.X using an automated tool.

Small part of IKVM project (http://www.ikvm.net) included in source-form (because of technical difficulties of using in binary form):
-Because we only require class structures from byte-code some parts of them are excluded for performance reasons
-These files are pretty-printed using ReSharper tool
